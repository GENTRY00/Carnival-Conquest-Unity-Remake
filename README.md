# GameJam_unity
A recreation of Carnival Conquest in Unity, developed after the game jam. This version allowed us to fix some of the original bugs without the constraints of a tight deadline and in a more familiar development environment.

# FIEA Game Jam
The FIEA Game Jam was a 48-hour event with teams of four participants. The prompt for the jam was "amusement park." Our team developed a split-screen competitive game where players aim to achieve the highest scores in various carnival mini-games within the time limit.
